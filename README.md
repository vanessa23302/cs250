* How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by breaking down what they ask for into smaller, clearer pieces. Creating user stories helps a lot because it puts the focus on what the user actually wants to do, not just what the system should do. Writing stories from the user’s point of view makes it easier to figure out the features we need to build and helps the whole team stay on the same page.

* How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I like breaking development into smaller chunks so it’s easier to manage and track progress. Using Agile made that much easier. I liked using sprints and daily standups to keep everything organized and flexible. Moving forward, I definitely want to keep using user stories, sprint planning, and retrospectives. These helped me stay focused, adapt when things changed, and communicate better with my team.

* What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means showing up, communicating clearly, and being willing to help when needed. It’s not just about doing your part but also about supporting your team and making sure everyone is working toward the same goal. I’ve learned that giving and getting feedback is just as important as writing code.
